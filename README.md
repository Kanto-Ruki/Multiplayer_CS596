The original idea of the project was going to be a rock paper scissors smash bros-esque style game where you would have to get a ring out with these attacks
	Rock would have a short range
	Paper would have an average range
	Scissors would have a long range
The original six sounds would have been audio for announcing attacks (3 for the main attacks), 1 for critical hits, 1 for being hit, and 1 for KO
I sadly did not have a trumpet sprite on hand to reinforce the trumpet sound effect
